Use case

What is different about the Family Tree Photo (NiFTree) sharing decentralized application, is the unique value of the assets. Everyone has an identity in life, everyone is a unique individual.  An Photo turned NFT to represent, reaffirm, and foster this concept is gratifying, fun, and establishes an inherent concept that others are unique individuals as well, because others have taken photos and their photos have value!  A photo, minted into a NFT(s) of individuals has value, and scarcity!
The Family Tree Photo concept is a beginning, a baby step towards a larger, much larger plan of inclusion.  Friends, large groups of friends, organizations, clubs, sport clubs and so many others can get in on the action as well!

The problem we are trying to solve is huge corporations are gathering (unsolicited) data on users and using and/or selling persons photographs and pertinent data.  As posting a photograph on Facebook, the photo and metadata may be used in perhaps unintended ways without user consent; to make a profit via identifing marketing targets or sold to marketing companies.
We hope to solve this problem, by bringing value back to the Photographers.  With a Family Tree Photo platform, application, the user gets to keep photos, store them and trade them and build photo albums, and they have value.
    Identity Value
    Monetary Value
A sense of being an individual with a stake, share, in something bigger.
This appeals to all our natures, people want to be respected as an individual, and also want to belong to something, some group that has meaning, focus, fun!

Methodology

Build a smart contract using Cadence > using Resources and Mint a NFT of a Photo(s) and resend to Photographer for storage
  (A family Member or Photographer sends Photos to a Publisher (NiFTree) for minting and recieves a Framed Photo)
  (The color of the Frame will denote scarcity)

How to deploy/run 




We need to have the ability to add pictures as NFT's (see line 102 in NonFungibleToken.cdc)
-> //Minting an NFT should be going the course of 'uploading' a picture and creating an NFT with it. Adding this NFT to your photo-collection which afterwards can be rated.

After we add the pictures, there should be a time at which voting commences to see who has the best photo-collection. Voting will commence after which the person with the highest amount of votes needs to receive a token.
